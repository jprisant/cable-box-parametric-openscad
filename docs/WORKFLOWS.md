# Workflows and Tuning Guide

This guide focuses on repeatable workflows for configuring, printing, and validating the parametric cable box.

## 1) Quick Start Workflow

1. Open `cable-management-box-parametric.scad` in OpenSCAD.
2. Open Customizer (`Window -> Customizer`, or `F3`).
3. Configure dimensions in sections: `Overall`, `Box`, `Post`, `Lid`, and `Openings`.
4. Press `F6` (full render).
5. Export STL for the current `Part_To_Render` value.
6. Repeat for `Box Only` and `Lid Only` if needed.

## 2) Dimensional Planning Workflow

Before changing parameters, measure:

- Largest cable connector width and height.
- Cable bend radius requirement near wall openings.
- Power brick footprint (if stored inside).
- Mounting/placement envelope on desk, shelf, or wall.

Translate measurements:

- `Box_Width` and `Box_Depth` from footprint plus clearance.
- `Box_Height` from tallest interior object plus routing margin.
- `All_Opening_Width` from thickest cable/connector dimension plus slack.
- `All_Opening_Height` from number of cables per wall and routing spread.

## 3) Lid Fit Calibration Workflow

### Objective
Achieve a consistent, repeatable friction fit across your printer/material profile.

### Steps

1. Start with default `Lid_Lip_Gap=0.1`.
2. Print a draft pair at final layer height and wall count.
3. Test fit after cooling to room temperature.
4. If too tight, increase by `0.05`.
5. If too loose, decrease by `0.05`.
6. Re-test until desired fit is reached.
7. Record your final value per filament type.

### Typical ranges

- PLA: `0.10` to `0.20`
- PETG: `0.15` to `0.30`
- ABS/ASA: `0.20` to `0.35`

Use these as starting points only.

## 4) Side Opening Workflow

### Baseline pattern

1. Set global values: `All_Opening_Width`, `All_Opening_Height`.
2. Enable walls using `Opening_On_*` toggles.
3. Use `All_Openings_Right` and `All_Openings_Up` for global shifts.

### Per-side refinement

1. Set side override width/height (`Override_Opening_*`) only when needed.
2. Use side-local offsets (`Move_Opening_*`) for asymmetry.
3. Keep overrides at `0` when global values are sufficient.

### Validation checklist

- Confirm openings do not intersect rounded corners too aggressively.
- Verify opening height still satisfies model assertion (`height > width` globally).
- Verify opening placement does not conflict with stabilizer zones unless intended.

## 5) Stabilizer Workflow

### When to enable

Use stabilizers when:

- Box walls are tall/thin.
- Internal loads are non-trivial.
- Opening cutouts remove too much wall stiffness.

### Configuration sequence

1. Enable `Enable_Stabilizers=true`.
2. Set geometry: `Stabilizer_Width`, `Stabilizer_Depth`, `Stabilizer_Height`.
3. Configure front/back count and alignment.
4. Configure left/right count and alignment.
5. Enable opening avoidance toggles for affected walls.

### Practical tuning

- Increase count before increasing depth for less interior intrusion.
- Keep depth moderate if routing many cables internally.
- Use `Distributed` with margins to avoid corner crowding.

## 6) Bottom Openings Workflow

### Strategy

Define geometry first, then placement.

1. Set `Enable_Bottom_Openings=true`.
2. Set geometry: width, depth, orientation, corner radius.
3. Choose arrangement axis (`Bottom_Opening_Axis`).
4. Choose primary/secondary alignments.
5. Set spacing (`0` for auto, or explicit value).
6. Apply margins for `Start`, `End`, or `Custom` modes.

### Post interaction

If center post is enabled and `Bottom_Opening_Avoid_Post=true`, openings are split around the post clearance region. This overrides centered behavior for post-safe placement.

## 7) Slicing Workflow (Small Print Beds)

### Use case

Enable slicing when full box/lid dimensions exceed your print bed width.

### Steps

1. Set `Enable_Slicing=true`.
2. Set `Slice_Count` to fit your bed dimensions.
3. Keep `Slice_Piece_To_Render=0` to preview all slices.
4. Switch `Slice_Piece_To_Render` to each index and export STLs one at a time.
5. Print and test one mating seam before full production.

### Clip tuning

- Tight assembly: increase `Clip_Tolerance` by `0.05`.
- Loose assembly: decrease `Clip_Tolerance` by `0.05`.
- Weak seam: increase `Clips_Per_Edge` or `Clip_Tab_Width`.

## 8) Printing Baseline

### Suggested starting profile (FDM)

- Nozzle: `0.4`
- Layer height: `0.2`
- Perimeters/Walls: `3+`
- Infill: `15%` to `25%`
- Top/Bottom layers: `4+`

### Orientation

- Box: open side up.
- Lid: top cosmetic surface orientation based on visual preference.
- Sliced parts: orient to maximize seam accuracy and clip strength.

## 9) CI Smoke Workflow

### GitHub Actions

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/scad-smoke.yml`
- Trigger: push affecting `.scad` files or manual dispatch
- Runs OpenSCAD smoke renders on Ubuntu

### Local

- Windows: run `scripts/scad-smoke.ps1`
- Linux/macOS: run `bash scripts/scad-smoke.sh`
- If needed on Bash environments, set `OPENSCAD_BIN` to your OpenSCAD executable path.

Smoke checks include:

- Baseline render
- Lid-only render
- Slicing preview render
- Expected fail case (`Slice_Piece_To_Render` out of range while slicing is enabled)

## 10) Troubleshooting Matrix

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Lid too tight | `Lid_Lip_Gap` too low | Increase by `0.05` and re-test. |
| Lid too loose | `Lid_Lip_Gap` too high | Decrease by `0.05` and re-test. |
| Side openings misaligned | Global + local offsets stacking | Reset one offset layer, then reapply intentionally. |
| Stabilizers intersect opening area | Avoid toggles disabled or margins too small | Enable avoid toggles and/or increase margins. |
| Floor openings collide with post | Post avoid disabled | Set `Bottom_Opening_Avoid_Post=true`. |
| Slice clips too hard to join | `Clip_Tolerance` too low | Increase tolerance incrementally. |
| Slice clips sloppy | `Clip_Tolerance` too high | Reduce tolerance and reprint seam test. |

## 11) Documentation and Contribution Workflow

When you add or change parameters:

1. Update `cable-management-box-parametric.scad` comments.
2. Update `docs/PARAMETER_REFERENCE.md`.
3. Update `docs/FAQ.md` for new troubleshooting cases.
4. Update `README.md` if user workflow changes.
5. If adding ready-made presets, place them in `library/`.
6. If sharing user-generated builds or forks, place them in `community/`.

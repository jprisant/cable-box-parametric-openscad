# CONTEXT (codex)

## Current Scope

Finalize v1 release baseline for the parametric cable-management OpenSCAD model.

## Constraints

- Preserve cross-agent compatibility with AGENTS/README.md.
- Keep public docs independent of _NOTES/.
- Keep source/license notices accurate.
- Keep v1 core release file Gridfinity-free.
- Keep experimental variants in `AGENTS/codex/WORKING/` until explicitly promoted.

## Current Priorities

- Complete validation required to push v1 live.
- Generate initial release artifacts (STL + PNG) for baseline coverage.
- Capture one physical print validation note for fit/tolerance.
- Stage and commit grouped baseline, then push/tag release.
